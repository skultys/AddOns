--------------------

Benjamin Staneck:
	- Update README.md
	remove WA1 to 2 instructions
	- change it so that when codereview is already open, clicking "show code" again closes the window
	- fix a typo, also adjust localizations to match
	- fix opening code review page when options haven't been opened before
	- make "Show Code" button translatable
	- remove OnUpdate script that broke the divider in the config
Infus:
	- WeakAurasOptions: Don't show the codereview window again
	Feels nicer. The user can hit the "show code" button to show
	the code again anyway.
	- Add code formatting to Show Code
	And fix a small copy paste error.
	- Implement show code for importing
	Ticket-number: 459
	- Fix checking for custom code
	Ticket-number: 459
	- Improve custom lua code checking
	By checking more places for custom code, and improving how visible it is.
Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Block getglobal from breaking out of the environment
Infus:
	- Hide() regions after creation
	Fixes a regression for
	Ticket: 156
	- Rewrite visibility checking
	In Expand() and Collapse() set a flag region.toShow, which indicates
	whether the region should be visible. Subsequent calls to Expand() or
	Collapse() that don't change toShow just return without performing any
	actions. (That fixes 402). While at that remove toHide as it is the
	inverse of toShow. Also introduce a region.animatingHide, indicating
	that a aura is in its hide animation.
	
	In the dynamic group simply check for region.toShow || region.animateHide.
	Since that removes the isVisible() check, this fixes Ticket 453.
	
	Also since auras that animate it's hiding are still positioned as
	visible auras, this fixes 156.
	
	Somewhere in this rewrite 454 is fixed too.
	- Fix DBM trigger with a non empty id and use_id false
	Namely the icon and progress functions
	
	Ticket: 458
